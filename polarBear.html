			<div>Polar Bears are hypercarnivorous creatures, meaning that their diet consists of at least 70% meat. Males are typically called boars while females are called sows. Due to large scale hunting and climate change, the polar bear is considered a vulnerable species. Although regulations and quotas were put into effect for hunting, polar bears remain at risk. Their diet mostly consists of seals and they tend to thrive around the areas where the ice meets water, the natural habitat of the aforementioned seals. Due to the lack of freshwater in its environment, polar bears obtain water through the metabolization and digestion of the fats found in seal blubber.</div>
