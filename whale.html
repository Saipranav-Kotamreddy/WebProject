			<div>Whales are an anomaly in the course of nature. As most of us have evolved and adapted from life in water to life on land, whales did the exact opposite. As mammals whose ancestors were land living animals, whales must regularly come up for air. As they were relentlessly hunted in the past, whales are now a critically endangered species that is constantly on the brink of extinction. Although some species of whale may display a sort of preference for certain type of fish, it is not believed that whales have a sense of taste as their taste buds are normally severely atrophied. Whales are also known for being highly intelligent creatures due to their brain to body mass ratio. They display complex emotions such as grief and take part in complex activities when playing.</div>
