			<div>The sealâ€™s a large spherical lens and mobile pupils allow it to have improved focusing abilities and filter out the intense glare of the light reflected from the snow. Having blubber around their core but not their extremities allows the seal to maintain a streamlined shape allowing for more efficient movement in water. However, their flippers have to depend on adaptations to their circulatory system in order to stay warm.</div>
