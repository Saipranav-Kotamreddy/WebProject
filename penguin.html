			<div> As flightless birds, the penguins’ vestigial wings work as flippers in order to provide control under water, the natural habitat of penguins’ food, fish. The natural two-tone color scheme of this bird has it having a black back in order to blend in from a top down view while swimming while its white belly make is hard for their natural underwater predators to discern them from the water’s surface. Given that the penguin has no natural land predators, they have no fear of humans and the like. Some natural predators of the penguin include the orca and the leopard seal.</div>
